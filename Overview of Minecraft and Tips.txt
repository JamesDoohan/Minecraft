<p> Welcome!
Have you ever wanted to explore new worlds where you could do anything and anything is possible? Well, now you can! Enter the world of Minecraft, where you can build to your heart's content (CREATIVE), or defeat monsters while protecting your 20 health points (SURVIVAL). Here are a few tips to help you get started. I'm focused on your survival, so let's get started!!</p>

<u>Surviving the first night</u>

<ul type="square">
<li> When you load up your world, you will either experience a nice world with great resources, or a bad world with nothing in sight. In either case, you should try to build up your resources before the baddies come out and dominate the night. The first thing you should do is collect wood.</li>
<p><li> Wood is the primary resource you should try to get. Wood allows you to make simple but important resources like a crafting table which you'll need later to make more things. Find a tree, walk up to it, and hit it repeatedly with your hand. A small chunk of wood will appear in your inventory. Then if you want you can get enough wood to last you a while. Place a wood block in your inventory crafting grid to make wood planks. Next, you place four planks in the inventory crafting grid and you'll get a crafting table! Crafting tables, as I said before, give you the opportunity to make endless items. <img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSEq5xgnS8cTGlI5DKyML706XLAvZkkqxeRcdvZ87cbBw8yu2SucQ"> Now, the first thing you should do is get a sword and torches. Head to the nearest cave and try to find coal, which is gray with black specks. Then open your crafting table and put a plank in to make sticks (Look at the diagram below).<img src="https://www.digminecraft.com/basic_recipes/images/make_stick.png"></li></P>

</ul>

<ul type= circle>
<p> <li> Using the key below, Write Your Three Messages Below! </li> </p>
<li> Write Here... </li>
<li> And Here... </li>
<li> And Last but not Least... Write Here. </li>
</ul>
